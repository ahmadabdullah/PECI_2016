In order to extract travelling waves from post-fault voltages and currents, and to construct an effective relaying algorithm, wavelet transforms were adopted. Because the fault information under the multiple frequency bands were used in the relaying algorithm; the SIR's reliability has been further improved. Theoretical analysis and EMTP simulations verified the directional relay. Finally, the paper introduces a scheme to implement the relay.},

The scheme uses zero-sequence current traveling waves to identify the faulted feeder, and the busbar residual voltage to determine an event caused by fault or switch operation. The current traveling waves measured by zero-sequence current transducers are decomposed using wavelet multiresolution analysis. The local modulus maxima of the wavelet transform are extracted to determine the time of the initial traveling wave. The wavelet transforms on all feeders at the time are compared in magnitude and polarity with each other to identify the faulted feeder. The feeder identification is independent of the network neutral-point grounding mode. The proposed scheme was implemented and verified using Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP)-generated signals. The scheme proved to be robust against transients generated during normal events, such as feeder energizing and de-energizing as well as capacitor bank switching.},

The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) technique is integrated with the probabilistic neural-network (PNN) model to construct the classifier. First, the multiresolution-analysis technique of DWT and the Parseval's theorem are employed to extract the energy distribution features of the distorted signal at different resolution levels. Then, the PNN classifies these extracted features to identify the disturbance type according to the transient duration and the energy features. Since the proposed methodology can reduce a great quantity of the distorted signal features without losing its original property, less memory space and computing time are required. Various transient events tested, such as momentary interruption, capacitor switching, voltage sag/swell, harmonic distortion, and flicker show that the classifier can detect and classify different power disturbance types efficiently.},

The other one is the reverse mho circle which is set according to the forward line surge impedance. The fault direction is determined per the relationship between the apparent surge impedance and the mho circles. The proposed algorithm was verified using PSCAD/EMTEDC software.

  Abstract                 = {Wind farms (WFs) are increasingly integrated with high-voltage (HV) grids, for which distance relaying is normally the protection of choice. This paper reveals some serious defects of distance protection for the lines connected to induction generator (IG)-based WFs during balanced faults. It is shown that for the squirrel cage IG (SCIG) WFs, distance protection becomes insecure, while for the doubly fed IG (DFIG) WFs, the relay performance is utterly unreliable, due to operating scenarios that are unique to such WFs, and are unfamiliar to the existing relaying practices. The detected failures can easily result in unnecessary WF tripping, thus jeopardizing the objectives pursued by the new grid codes that oblige WFs to remain connected to the grid during disturbances. Moreover, a novel modified permissive overreach transfer trip (POTT) scheme along with a fault current classification technique is proposed to address these problems for both types of IG-based WFs, and the accurate nondelayed protection of a distance relay over the entire line length is restored. A comprehensive performance evaluation confirms the findings of this paper and validates the efficacy of the proposed solution for all operating conditions. Results are particularly promising for the DFIG-based WFs with nonzero crowbar resistance, which is the most likely situation confronted by distance relays.},

The results indicate that the speed and selectivity of the approach are quite adequate for a number of different transmission and distribution monitoring, control, and protection applications.},

This paper presents a novel technique for accurate discrimination between an internal fault and a magnetizing inrush current in the power transformer by combining wavelet transforms with neural networks. The wavelet transform is firstly applied to decompose the differential current signals of the power transformer into a series of detailed wavelet components. The spectral energies of the wavelet components are calculated and then employed to train a neural network to discriminate an internal fault from the magnetizing inrush current. The simulated results presented clearly show that the proposed technique can accurately discriminate between an internal fault and a magnetizing inrush current in power transformer protection.},

The new algorithm can simultaneously identify all harmonics including integer, noninteger and subharmonics. In the first step of the approach, the frequency spectrum of the waveform is decomposed into subbands using discrete wavelet packet transform filter banks. In the second step, continuous wavelet transform is applied to nonzero subbands to evaluate the harmonic contents, In the first step, there is the problem of images due to down samplings and up samplings of the waveform, A method for alleviating this image problem is developed in the paper. Methods are developed to accurately quantify harmonics frequency amplitude and phase. The approach is validated by its application to synthesised waveforms and to power system waveforms measured in the Western Australia system. It is found to be powerful and suitable for practical use.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a discussion about the optimum time step size and maximum simulation time in EMTP-based programs. This is of particular importance for new users of EMTP-based programs, since the user is responsible for setting up these parameters before running a simulation case. The selection of the time step size affects the precision of the simulation. The time step size depends on the maximum frequency expected in the phenomena, which is normally unknown, a priori. The calculation of eigenvalues from the state space matrix obtained from the EMTP conductance matrix and history terms algorithm formulation allows the exact ideal values for the optimal time step size and a maximum simulation time. In comparison, a general and robust algorithm is also presented here based on all the input data given for the circuit under simulation. The proposed calculation process is based on single- or multi-phase uncoupled or coupled circuits, with lumped or distributed parameters. Simulations are given demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed rules. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {An important macroscopic arc parameter, describing its complex nature is the arc resistance. It can be easily calculated by using the well-known Warrington formula. Authors investigated the results of Warrington's tests. By taking into account the conditions under which they are obtained (e.g., inaccurate measurement devices), it is unquestionable that these results are today highly empirical and not accurate and general enough. Laboratory testing provided in the high-power test laboratory FGH-Mannheim (Germany), in which long high current arcs are initiated, was the basis for the research results presented in the paper. Based on the analysis of laboratory-recorded are voltage and current waveforms, the new arc model is derived. An example of arc computer simulation using the new model is given. Based on the new are model, a new approach to arc resistance calculation is presented. The new formula for arc resistance is compared with the old Warrington formula.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Fault section identification and determining its location are important aspects to reduce down/repair time, speed up restoration of power supply and to improve the reliability. In this paper combined wavelet and artificial neural network based directional protection scheme is proposed for double circuit transmission lines using single end data to identify the faulty section and its location with reach setting up to 99% of line length. The proposed method requires the three phase currents and voltage to be measured at one end of the double circuit transmission line modelled using distributed parameter line model which also considers the effect of shunt capacitance. Approximate coefficients feature vector of the three phase voltage and current are extracted using discrete wavelet transform to train the \{ANN\} with Levenberg Marquardt algorithm. The proposed scheme involves two stages. The first stage identifies the zone/section of the fault and the second stage calculates the fault location from the relaying point. The proposed combined Wavelet and \{ANN\} based fault location scheme is also compared with \{ANFIS\} based fault location scheme. The test results of the proposed scheme show that the fault section identification and location estimation is very accurate and the average percentage error in fault location estimation is within 0.001%. This method is adaptive to the variation of fault type (both forward and reverse), fault inception angle, fault location and fault resistance. The main advantage of the proposed scheme is that it offers primary protection to 99% of line length using single end data only and also backup protection to the adjacent forward and reverse line sections. },
