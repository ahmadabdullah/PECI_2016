Good work on the study cases but still need some figures or charts to strengthen the result.

The concept of the work is very relevant. Wavelet Transform gives a very clear picture of the time and the frequency information of the transients. But many things are not clear in the paper.

1) What is the mother wavelet you are using and will a single type of mother wavelet be able to
distinguish transients due to switching,lighting or faults?? 2) It is not clear as how you are using the coefficients to identify the type of faults?? please explain more.
3) Detailed algorithm is required as it should be an online process of constant fault vigilance.

4) Most important "RESULT SHOULD BE MORE DESCRIPTIVE"

Interesting paper that proposes a very accurate fault classification within only one eighth of a cycle. I'd like to see the detailed procedure in the full paper.

The paper is well written. On this paper results should be included to validate your proposal.

Generally, the method seems promising for fault identification. However, there are some issues that should be addressed in the full paper:

    Citation needed for "distance relay can only protect up to 85% of the line instantaneously".

    Criticism of communication-based relaying as bad because they might utilize the internet is a straw man argument---unless you have evidence that operators are using the internet to communicate between relays connected to the same transmission line.

    How well does the method perform when the operating conditions (e.g., steady-state line flows) change? Would the ANN have to be retrained for each operating condition?

    Are there a possibility for false positives due to intentional switching or load/gen variation?

    How well does this method compare against prior published methods (e.g., those that use voltage as well as current measurements)?
