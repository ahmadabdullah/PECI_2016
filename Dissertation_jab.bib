  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a novel approach for the classification of power quality disturbances. The approach is based on inductive learning by using decision trees. The wavelet transform is utilized to produce representative feature vectors that can accurately capture the unique and salient characteristics of each disturbance. In the training phase, a decision tree is developed for the power quality disturbances. The decision tree is obtained based on the features produced by the wavelet analysis through inductive inference. During testing, the signal is recognized using the rules extracted from the decision tree. The classification accuracy of the decision tree is not only comparable with the classification accuracy of artificial Neural networks, but also accounts for the explanation of the disturbance classification via the produced if... then rules.},

  Abstract                 = {The paper presents a measurement method for power quality analysis in electrical power systems. The method is the evolution of an iterative procedure already set up by the authors and allows the most relevant disturbances in electrical power systems to be detected, localized and estimated automatically. The detection of the disturbance and its duration are attained by a proper application, on the sampled signal, of the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Disturbance amplitude is estimated by decomposing, in an optimized way, the signal in frequency subbands by means of the discrete time wavelet transform (DTWT). The proposed method is characterized by high rejection to noise, introduced by both measurement chain and system under test, and it is designed for an agile disturbance classification. Moreover, it is also conceived for future implementation both in a real-time measurement equipment and in an off-line analysis tool. In the paper firstly the theoretical background is reported and briefly discussed. Then, the proposed method is described in detail. Finally, some case-studies are examined in order to highlight the performance of the method},

The excellent timeâ€”frequency resolution characteristics of the S-transform makes it an attractive candidate for the analysis of power quality (PQ) disturbances under noisy condition and has the ability to detect the disturbance correctly. On the other hand, the performance of wavelet transform (WT) degrades while detecting and localizing the disturbances in the presence of noise. Features extracted by using the S-transform are applied to a modular NN for automatic classification of the PQ disturbances that solves a relatively complex problem by decomposing it into simpler subtasks. Modularity of neural network provides better classification, model complexity reduction and better learning capability, etc. Eleven types of PQ disturbances are considered for the classification. The simulation results show that the combination of the S-transform and a modular NN can effectively detect and classify different power quality disturbances.},

It is a two-stage system in which a mulitersolution S-transform is used to generate a set of optimal feature vectors in the first stage. The multiresolution S-transform is based on a variable width analysis window, which changes with frequency according to a user-defined function. Thus, the resolution in time or the related resolution in frequency is a general function of the frequency and two parameters, which can be chosen according to signal characteristics. The multiresolution S-transform can be seen either as a phase-corrected version of the wavelet transform or a variable window short time Fourier transform that simultaneously localizes both real and imaginary spectra of the signal. The features obtained from S-transform analysis of the power quality disturbance signals are much more amenable for pattern recognition purposes unlike the currently available wavelet transform techniques. In stage two, a fuzzy logic-based pattern recognition system is used to classify the various disturbance waveforms generated due to power quality violations. The fuzzy approach is found to be very simple and classification accuracy is more than 98% in most cases of power quality disturbances.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a novel fault-detection technique of high-impedance faults (HIFs) in high-voltage transmission lines using the wavelet transform. The wavelet transform (WT) has been successfully applied in many fields. The technique is based on using the absolute sum value of coefficients in multiresolution signal decomposition (MSD) based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). A fault indicator and fault criteria are then used to detect the HIF in the transmission line. In order to discriminate between HIF and nonfault transient phenomena, such as capacitor and line switching and arc furnace loads, the concept of duration time (i.e., the transient time period), is presented. On the basis of extensive investigations, optimal mother wavelets for the detection of HIF are chosen. It is shown that the technique developed is robust to fault type, fault inception angle, fault resistance, and fault location. The paper demonstrates a new concept and methodology in HIF in transmission lines. The performance of the proposed technique is tested under a variety of fault conditions on a typical 154-kV Korean transmission-line system.},

  Abstract                 = {Traditional directional power and current protection requires the current and the voltage to be measured. The directional current protection equipment is only capable for tripping the faulty incomer. While the direction in which the fault occurs is detected by measuring the direction of current flow, or in other words the phase displacement between the current and voltage. This study introduces a directional protection technique with phase selection based on measuring the current only. The correlogram function principle is applied on two successive current cycles. The two cycles are based on the pre- and post-fault current signals. The ability to differentiate between a fault in one direction and others is obtained using the sign of correlogram coefficients while its magnitude is used to identify the faulted phase. A proposed directional relay characteristic with correlogram coefficients calculated pre- and during the fault are also introduced. Different cases of non-symmetrical faults have been studied on a real recorded fault data for 240-kV transmission system at the province of Alberta-Canada. The results showed that the proposed technique is simple and reliable not only to identify the fault direction but also to select the faulted phases.},

The modal voltage and current are decomposed by Daubechies 4 wavelet in both time and frequency. The different decomposition coefficients on different scales reflecting different frequency information are used to calculate the transient characteristic of voltage and current. The transient characteristic is then utilized to obtain the transient energy of the fault that is employed to identify the fault position. Simulation results show that the proposed protection scheme based on transient energy is applicable and encouraging. It is independent of fault type, switching angle and generation mode; not influenced by recloser and lightning surge. Single-line ground fault with high fault resistance can also be detected correctly. The proposed protection scheme has good selectivity, reliability and sensitivity.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposed a novel approach for the Power Quality (PQ) disturbances classification based on the wavelet transform and self organizing learning array (SOLAR) system. Wavelet transform is utilized to extract feature vectors for various PQ disturbances based on the multiresolution analysis (MRA). These feature vectors then are applied to a SOLAR system for training and testing. SOLAR has three advantageous over a typical neural network: data driven learning, local interconnections and entropy based self-organization. Several typical PQ disturbances are taken into consideration in this paper. Comparison research between the proposed method, the support vector machine (SVM) method and existing literature reports show that the proposed method can provide accurate classification results. By the hypothesis test of the averages, it is shown that there is no statistically significant difference in performance of the proposed method for PQ classification when different wavelets are chosen. This means one can choose the wavelet with short wavelet filter length to achieve good classification results as well as small computational cost. Gaussian white noise is considered and the Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the performance of the proposed method in different noise conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {A new fault location principle using one terminal voltage and current data for EHV transmission lines is described in this paper, which is based on distributed parameter line model, breaking through the traditional single-ended fault location ideas. The voltage profile along the healthy line could be calculated using single-ended voltage and current data; however, the voltage profile behind the fault point is not true for a faulted line. Even though, notice the fact that the norm value of derivative function of the "fictitious profile" to distance is minimum at fault point, based on which the fault location function is constructed. The numerical algorithm is also described; this principle is proved by EMTP simulations to be immune to fault resistance, fault types, and fault inception angle. Theoretically, the accuracy of the principle is proportional to the sampling rate of the locator.},

  Abstract                 = {By means of the wavelet transform (WT), a power quality (PQ) monitoring system could easily and correctly detect and localize the disturbances in the power systems. However, the signal under investigation is often corrupted by noises, especially the ones with overlapping high-frequency spectrum of the transient signals. The performance of the WT in detecting the disturbance would be greatly degraded, due to the difficulty of distinguishing the noises and the disturbances. To enhance the capability of the WT-based PQ monitoring system, this paper proposes a de-noising approach to detection of transient disturbances in a noisy environment. In the proposed de-noising approach, a threshold of eliminating the influences of noises is determined adaptively according to the background noises. The abilities of the WT in detecting and localizing the disturbances can hence be restored. To test the effectiveness of the developed de-noising scheme, employed were diverse data obtained from the EMTP/ATP programs for the main transient disturbances in the power systems as well as from actual field tests. Using the approach proposed in this paper, remarkable efficiency of monitoring the PQ problems and high tolerance to the noises are approved},

  Abstract                 = {Wind farms (WFs) are increasingly integrated with high-voltage (HV) grids, for which distance relaying is normally the protection of choice. This paper reveals some serious defects of distance protection for the lines connected to induction generator (IG)-based WFs during balanced faults. It is shown that for the squirrel cage IG (SCIG) WFs, distance protection becomes insecure, while for the doubly fed IG (DFIG) WFs, the relay performance is utterly unreliable, due to operating scenarios that are unique to such WFs, and are unfamiliar to the existing relaying practices. The detected failures can easily result in unnecessary WF tripping, thus jeopardizing the objectives pursued by the new grid codes that oblige WFs to remain connected to the grid during disturbances. Moreover, a novel modified permissive overreach transfer trip (POTT) scheme along with a fault current classification technique is proposed to address these problems for both types of IG-based WFs, and the accurate nondelayed protection of a distance relay over the entire line length is restored. A comprehensive performance evaluation confirms the findings of this paper and validates the efficacy of the proposed solution for all operating conditions. Results are particularly promising for the DFIG-based WFs with nonzero crowbar resistance, which is the most likely situation confronted by distance relays.},

This paper presents a protection technique based on the high-frequency transients generated by the fault to cover almost the total length of multiterminal transmission lines. For this purpose, appropriately designed line traps are installed at terminals of the protected transmission line, and the support vector machine is used to classify the internal and external faults based on the frequency spectrum of the current signals decomposed by the wavelet transform. Extensive simulation studies indicate that the proposed approach is well capable of discriminating between the internal and external faults and provides a very fast, secure, and reliable protection technique.},

The proposed protection algorithm presents a discriminating method based on the polarity, magnitude, and time interval between the detected traveling waves at the relay location. A supplemental algorithm consisting of a high-set overcurrent relay as well as an impedance-based relay is also proposed. This is done to overcome the well-known shortcomings of traveling-wave-based protection techniques for the detection of very close-in faults and single-phase-to-ground faults occurring at small voltage magnitudes. The proposed technique is evaluated for the protection of a two-terminal transmission line. Extensive simulation studies using PSCAD/EMTDC software indicate that the proposed approach is reliable for rapid and correct identification of various fault cases. It identifies most of the internal faults very rapidly in less than 2 ms. In addition, the proposed technique presents high noise immunity.},

This algorithm is capable of estimating the phasor parameters in a quarter cycle of an input signal. It features fast response and achieves high accuracy over a wide range of frequency deviations. The signal sampling rate and data window size can be selected to meet desirable applications requirements, such as fast response, high accuracy, and low computational burden. Besides, an approach for eliminating a decaying dc component, which has a significant impact on estimating phasors, is proposed by using a recursive wavelet transform.

Traveling wave theory is utilized in capturing the travel time of the transients along the monitored lines between the fault point and the relay. Time resolution for the high frequency components of the fault transients, is provided by the wavelet transform. This information is related to the travel time of the signals which are already decomposed into their modal components. The aerial mode is used for all fault types, whereas the ground mode is used to resolve problems associated with certain special cases. The wavelet transform is found to be an excellent discriminant for identifying the traveling wave reflections from the fault, irrespective of the fault type and impedance. EMTP simulations are used to test and validate the proposed fault location approach for typical power system faults},

  Abstract                 = {Better software and hardware for automatic classification of power quality (PQ) disturbances are desired for both utilities and commercial customers. Existing automatic recognition methods need improvement in terms of their capability, reliability, and accuracy. This paper presents the theoretical foundation of a new method for classifying voltage and current waveform events that are related to a variety of PQ problems. The method is composed of two sequential processes: feature extraction and classification. The proposed feature extraction tool, time-frequency ambiguity plane with kernel techniques, is new to the power engineering field. The essence of the feature exaction is to project a PQ signal onto a low-dimension time-frequency representation (TFR), which is deliberately designed for maximizing the separability between classes. The technique of designing an optimized TFR from time-frequency ambiguity plane is for the first time applied to the PQ classification problem. A distinct TFR is designed for each class. The classifiers include a Heaviside-function linear classifier and neural networks with feedforward structures. The flexibility of this method allows classification of a very broad range of power quality events. The performance validation and hardware implementation of the proposed method are presented in the second part of this two-paper series.},

The proposed method requires less number of features as compared to wavelet based approach for the identification of PQ events. The features extracted through the S-Transform are trained by a PNN for automatic classification of the PQ events. Since the proposed methodology can reduce the features of the disturbance signal to a great extent without losing its original property, less memory space and learning PNN time are required for classification. Eleven types of disturbances are considered for the classification problem. The simulation results reveal that the combination of S-Transform and PNN can effectively detect and classify different PQ events. The classification performance of PNN is compared with a feedforward multilayer (FFML) neural network (NN) and learning vector quantization (LVQ) NN. It is found that the classification performance of PNN is better than both FFML and LVQ.},

  Abstract                 = {Identification and classification of voltage and current disturbances in power systems are important tasks in the monitoring and protection of power system. Most power quality disturbances are non-stationary and transitory and the detection and classification have proved to be very demanding. The concept of discrete wavelet transform for feature extraction of power disturbance signal combined with artificial neural network and fuzzy logic incorporated as a powerful tool for detecting and classifying power quality problems. This paper employes a different type of univariate randomly optimized neural network combined with discrete wavelet transform and fuzzy logic to have a better power quality disturbance classification accuracy. The disturbances of interest include sag, swell, transient, fluctuation, and interruption. The system is modeled using VHSIC hardware description language (VHDL), a hardware description language, followed by extensive testing and simulation to verify the functionality of the system that allows efficient hardware implementation of the same. This proposed method classifies, and achieves 98.19% classification accuracy for the application of this system on software-generated signals and utility sampled disturbance events.},

A neural-fuzzy network is used to model the dynamics of the power transmission system in fault-free conditions.

If a fault threshold, defined by the fault detection and isolation (FDI) algorithm, is exceeded then deviation from normal operation can be detected at its early stages and an alarm can be launched. In several cases fault isolation can be also performed, that is the sources of fault in the power transmission system can be also identified. The performance of the proposed methodology is tested through simulation experiments.},

The key idea underlying the approach is to decompose a given disturbance signal into other signals which represent a smoothed version and a detailed version of the original signal. The decomposition is performed using multiresolution signal decomposition techniques. We demonstrate and test our proposed technique to detect and localize disturbances with actual power line disturbances. In order to enhance the detection outcomes, we utilize the squared wavelet transform coefficients of the analyzed power line signal. Based on the results of the detection and localization, we carry out an initial investigation of the ability to uniquely characterize various types of power quality disturbances. This investigation is based on characterizing the uniqueness of the squared wavelet transform coefficients for each power quality disturbance},

Parallel transmission lines can be decoupled into the common component net and differential component net. In differential component net, the current distributing coefficient is a function of fault distance, and the differential component current at the fault point can be expressed in terms of the current at the local terminal. Therefore, for asymmetrical faults, the phase fault current can also be expressed as a function of local terminal current and fault distance. With the fault boundary conditions for a given fault type, the fault location equations can then be derived. Based on distributed parameter line model, the proposed algorithm achieves superior locating accuracy, with mutual coupling between circuits, source impedance and fault resistance having very little influence on the locating accuracy. The performance of new algorithm is verified by computer simulation results for transposed and non-transposed lines.},

  Abstract                 = {The application of deregulation policies in electric power systems results in the absolute necessity to quantify power quality. This fact highlights the need for a new classification strategy which is capable of tracking, detecting, and classifying power-quality events. In this paper, a new classification approach that is based on the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm is proposed. The new algorithm is supported by the vector quantization (VQ) and the fast match (FM) techniques to speed up the classification process. The Walsh transform (WT) and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) are adopted as feature extraction tools. The application of the combined fast match-dynamic time warping (FM-DTW) algorithms provides superior results in speed and accuracy compared to the traditional artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic classifiers. Moreover, the proposed classifier proves to have a very low sensitivity to noise levels.},

  Abstract                 = {Voltage dip is a frequently occurring power-quality problem that electricity consumers face. Knowledge of the source and magnitude of the voltage dip is desirable; however, complete monitoring of the power system is prohibitive. State estimation for both fundamental and harmonic frequencies was presented previously. Its ability to utilize limited measurements for system-wide estimation has proven to be very effective. In this paper, the technique is extended further to estimate power system transients. Transient state estimation (TSE) provides an effective and systematic approach in locating and identifying remote fault sources, thus allowing the problem to be addressed more efficiently. The proposed approach formulates the system using state-space theory and results in a system of first-order differential equations which are used to form the measurement system. The estimation is the simultaneous solution of the measurement system equations based on a time sequence of snapshots of the system measurements. Additional measurement information utilizes the voltage and current history measurements where they are approximated using backward Euler integration formula, are also supplied to the TSE algorithm. To evaluate the performance of the proposed TSE, transients caused by a sudden lost of a system load have been simulated on the test system. This paper provides a new methodology to estimate a complete transient profile of a power system.},

  Abstract                 = {Knowledge of the process noise covariance matrix Q is essential for the application of Kalman filtering. However, it is usually a difficult task to obtain an explicit expression of Q for large time varying systems. This paper looks at an adaptive Kalman filter method for dynamic harmonic state estimation and harmonic injection tracking. The method models the system as a linear frequency independent state model and does not require an exact knowledge of the noise covariance matrix Q. As an alternative, the proposed adaptive Kalman filter switches between the two basic Q models for steady-state and transient estimation. Its adaptive function allows for the resetting of the Kalman gain to avoid Kalman filter divergence problems under steady-state and allow fast tracking of system variations in transient conditions. Simulation results on the 220 kV network of the lower South Island of New Zealand are presented to validate this approach.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a fast pilot directional protection based on waveform integral of traveling wave for high voltage transmission line. Within a very short time of post-fault, the waveforms of positive and negative direction traveling waves are integrated, respectively, and their relevant ratio is calculated. According to the propagation characteristics of traveling wave, an operation threshold is set. If the ratio value is less than this threshold, the fault direction is thought as positive; otherwise, if the ratio value is higher than this threshold, the fault direction is negative. Through comparing the identification results of fault direction from two terminals of the protected line, the internal fault or external fault can be determined rapidly. To test the protection performance, an ultra high voltage (UHV) transmission line model was constructed and the extensive simulations were performed. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed protection technique can fast and reliably discriminate the internal faults from external faults. Generally, the performance of protection is hardly influenced by the fault resistance, fault inception angle and busbar configuration, etc.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a prototype wavelet-based neural-network classifier for recognizing power-quality disturbances is implemented and tested under various transient events. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) technique is integrated with the probabilistic neural-network (PNN) model to construct the classifier. First, the multiresolution-analysis technique of DWT and the Parseval's theorem are employed to extract the energy distribution features of the distorted signal at different resolution levels. Then, the PNN classifies these extracted features to identify the disturbance type according to the transient duration and the energy features. Since the proposed methodology can reduce a great quantity of the distorted signal features without losing its original property, less memory space and computing time are required. Various transient events tested, such as momentary interruption, capacitor switching, voltage sag/swell, harmonic distortion, and flicker show that the classifier can detect and classify different power disturbance types efficiently.},
